----------  ----------  -------------------------
2023-02-14      8.5     Wrote the entire program today on my day off.
                        I worked out my functions and realized that I needed
                        to add one more. I also discovered that I needed to install
                        with pip the dateutil extension to be able to accomplish everything
                        I wanted to in one of my functions.
                        I finished up the main part of my program and manually tested it to make
                        sure that it worked. Then I added in spacing and extra printed lines to
                        make it look neater. After that I worked on my test functions and got those
                        completed.
