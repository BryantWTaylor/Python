Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

Honestly I think the most powerful moment I had with functions was when I was writing my major program.
It was during that time that I realized how powerful and versatile a function is. When I code I usually
will go back and look at reference code from projects that I have done in the past to try and remind myself
how to code something. But I was finding that I was able to take some pieces of my previous code almost in
its fullness because good functions use paramaters and can be reused when needed.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

I had trouble seeing the value of test functions at first, but I realized that we are able to create a
test function that asserts or claims that if we run these paramaters through this function we should see this
result. And what that means is we are essentially able to write a function to shows what we expect our outcome
to be and see if we are correct. If we aren't then we look at what we might have done wrong. It is a valueable
tool.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Currently my process is to look at the error message that it throws at me, because usually it is because I 
get a TypeError or a ValueError or something that will tell me roughly where I went wrong and so I go and try
to fix it if I can figure out what I did wrong. If the program runs through just fine and I get a result that I wasn't
expecting, then I will use the debug tool to watch what is going on in the process of the code running and see where
it went off track. I know that I can improve my process by writing test functions and writing for exceptions. I 
will only get more comfortable with it if I try.
